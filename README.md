Welcome to my repo 👋, my name's Benjamin Cai, an aspiring software developer, full-stack engineer and guitarist  🎸.

🏗  Current developments are mostly focused on developing projects with JavaScipt or React on the frontend and Node.js as the backend. 

🚀  Personal interests include all things FinTech and crypto.

⾦  Lately, I've also been learning Rust and enjoying reading "the book".
