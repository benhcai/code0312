👋  Hi, I’m Benjamin Cai, an aspiring software developer, full-stack engineer and guitarist 🎸.

🏗  Current developments: mostly focused on developing projects with JavaScipt or React on the frontend and Node.js as the backend. 
🚀  Personally interests include all things crypto.

Lately, I've been learning and enjoying Rust and reading "the book".
